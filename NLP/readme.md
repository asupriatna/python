Prerequisites: 
Download the official Stanford Parser from https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-parser-4.2.0.zip, which seems to work quite well. You can try out a later version by going to this website http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download and checking the Release History section. After downloading, unzip it to a known location in your filesystem. Once done, you are now ready to use the parser from nltk , which we will be exploring soon.
